      <description>Code as request 2 Every lunch time, my team will struggle finding place to have lunch. Everyone will ask each other &amp;ldquo;Where will we have lunch today?&amp;rdquo;, and most of us would say &amp;ldquo;anywhere&amp;rdquo;. We waste time here up to minutes a day. We have tried 3 approaches.
Line vote In Line application, there is a feature to create poll and let everyone in group vote the result. Sound great.</description>
